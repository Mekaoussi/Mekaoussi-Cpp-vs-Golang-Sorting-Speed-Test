# Cpp-vs-Golang-Sorting-Speed-Test
comparing these 2 languages in sorting speed 
basically the thing i did was inspired by a video this guy made on Youtube where he practised the same test with Golang vs Python so i tried to do the same but with c++ 
,and this test's main function is to calculate the amount of time taken to finish a set of tasks,
1-Appending 10**5 random values from 0 to 100 to an array.
2-Sorting the array from smallest to biggest.
3-Printing the array's values.
4-Counting for how many times a specific value was appended to the array.
