# Cpp-vs-Golang-Sorting-Speed-Test
comparing these 2 languages in sorting speed 
basically what i did was ispired by a video this guy did on Youtube where he did a the same test with Golang vs Python so i tried to do the same but with c++ 
,and this test's main function is calcualting the ammount of time taken to finish a set of tasks,
1-Appending 10**5 random values from 0 to 100 to an array.
2-Sorting the array from smalles to biggest.
3-Printing the array's values.
4-Counting for how many times a specific value was appended to the array.
